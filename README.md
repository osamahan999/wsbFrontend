Wallstreet Bets Tycoon: https://osamahan999.github.io/wsbFrontend/
The backend is offline because I am out of google cloud credits :(


To run on your own machine:

1. Clone my frontend repository
2. Remove node modules if I havent cleaned that up by the time you see this, and run npm install
3. Go to github.com/osamahan999/wsbBackend/ and set up the backend 
4. Refactor all the HTTP requests to your own backend, probably localhost:5000. Refactor by simply changing all occurances of string "https://wallstreet-bets-tycoon-backend.uc.r.appspot.com/" to your backend server.
